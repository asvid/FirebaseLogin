## How to make it work

You need to have properly configured Firebase, which means:
- package name of app has to be **THE SAME** in firebase project
- added SHA1 keys so you can render proper google-services.json
  - remember to add your debugging key 
  ```bash
  keytool -list -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -keypass android
  ```
- configured logging methods
  - email
  - google
  - facebook - https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/facebook-login
  - anonymous

In app manifest add

```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
        android:value="@string/facebook_application_id"/>
```
And create XML file in *values* folder containing
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
```xml
<resources>
  <string name="facebook_application_id" translatable="false">1808813719132692</string>
  <string name="facebook_login_protocol_scheme" translatable="false">fb1808813719132692</string>
</resources>
```
in yout project build.gradle add
```groovy
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
    ...
```

in yout app build.gradle on the **very end** add
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

## How to use

First you need to initialize library in your login activity with giving context and client_id generated from google-services.json
```kotlin
    UserLoginService.initWith(this, resources.getString(R.string.default_web_client_id))
```
Google and Facebook logging is using *activity results* so you need to add this in your login activity
```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    UserLoginService.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
  }
```
Next, you should subscribe to libs observable
```kotlin
UserLoginService.observable.subscribe(
        { onNext -> doOnNext(onNext) },
        { onError -> doOnError(onError) }
    )
```
to cover all possible signals do something similar to:
```kotlin
private fun doOnNext(signal: Signal) {
    if (signal.isError()) {
      when (signal.error) {
        is WrongPassword -> showErrorToast(signal.error)
        is EmailAlreadyUsed -> showErrorToast(signal.error)
        is WeakPassword -> showErrorToast(signal.error)
      }
    } else {
      when (signal.status) {
        is UserLogged -> Toast.makeText(this, "user logged", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        is AccountCreated -> Toast.makeText(this, "account created", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        is UserLoggedOut -> Toast.makeText(this, "user logged out", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }
    }
    setUserData()
  }
```
And it should work :)
